We are the students of <i><b>Amity International School, VKC, Lucknow</i></b>. We made this app for the <u><b>Hackathon 2020 Competition</b></u>. We are very thankful to our respected <b>Chairperson ma'am</b> and <b>Principal maâ€™am</b> for giving us such an opportunity.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This app is basically made to help our teachers who are facing issues during online classes. In the tough times of COVID-19 pandemic, schools are providing study material and classes to students with the meduim of Internet. So as students, we have made this app to resolve the various problems faced by our teachers. This app is exclusively made for schools using <u><i>Microsoft Teams</i></u> for online classes. 
<br>
Thanking You.
